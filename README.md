This is some code for a website that will be used to upload treadmill workouts to Strava.


Feature list:
- Only allow users to access the page where you are able to add workouts to strava after loggin in
- Be able to add workouts to strava

PREREQ:
- understand how PHP works. 
    Need a general understanding, also have these questions:
    ? How do you get a user action to trigger PHP code to run?
    ? How does the syntax work?

TODO:

Add to the treadmillForm.php file a form to add a new workout to the strava account

IV. Strava Treadmill Function Page
    1. Build UI
        a. need form for the user to enter the workout the want to add
        b. need a logout button (optional)

    2. need to add API PUSH reqeusts that create new workouts for my strava account based on the information in the form
    3. Have functionality built in to read past workouts for the user (have this done for my personal use, would need to change this slightly if you decide to open this up for other peoples use)
